## PBJ Documentation Assignment for INFM600
### Janice Chan

#### Supplies needed:
- A dish, cutting board, or other clean surface for preparing the sandwich
- A butter knife or table knife
- Two slices of bread (you can choose whatever kind of bread you prefer, but avoid airy bread with big holes like sourdough; supermarket bread works best)
- A jar of crunchy or creamy peanut butter, or at least 1 oz., though it does not need to be measured
- A jar of jam or jelly, or at least 1 oz., though it does not need to be measured (while grape and strawberry are popular choices, you are not limited to these two options; however, note that sweeter jam works better as opposed to marmalade)
- Optional: plastic sandwich bag or container if taking your sandwich to go

#### Assembly:
_For further reference, you may also see “What Success Looks Like When Making a Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich” (https://github.com/jychan-umd/class1/blob/master/PBJvisuals.png)._
1.	Take your two slices of bread out of the package, then open them like a book and place them flat on your dish or cutting board so that you have the largest surface area available.
2.	Dip the blade of the table knife into the jam and begin spreading it on one slice of bread.  Cover the surface facing upward with an even layer all the way out until it extends nearly all the way to the crust.  Ensure that the layer of jam is thick enough so that the jam is sitting on top of the bread and not just scraped across and into the crevices of the bread—you should not be able to clearly see the texture of the bread beneath the jam.  How thick of a layer depends on your preference but it should be at least 2 mm.  (Precise measurement is not required.)
3.	Scrape any remaining jam off the knife along the edge of the slice of bread so that the leftover jam joins the existing layer.
4.	Dip the blade of the table knife into the peanut butter and begin spreading it on the opposite (not yet covered) slice of bread.  Again, you want to cover the surface with an even layer of peanut butter, which should be thick enough that you cannot see the texture of the bread through the peanut butter, and should again extend nearly all the way to the crust.  How thick of a layer depends on your preference but it should be at least 2 mm.
5.	Set the knife aside.
6.	Pick up one slice of bread (carefully, so that you do not get peanut butter or jam on your hands).  Place it on top of the other slice so that the peanut butter and jam covered sides are facing each other, and so that the edges of the crust on both slices line up.
7.	If desired or needed, you may cut the sandwich in half (diagonally or down the center) for easier eating, and/or place it in the sandwich bag or container if not eating immediately.
8.	Enjoy!
